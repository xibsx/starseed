Starseed is a simple WhatsApp bot designed for quick setup and efficient use. It offers essential features such as sticker creation, social media content downloading, basic group management tools, and various general-purpose utilities, all accessible directly through WhatsApp.

> [!CAUTION]
This project directly implements [`@itsliaaa/baileys`](https://github.com/itsliaaa/baileys#readme). It is not compatible with other Baileys forks, including the original Baileys package.

### ⚙️ Architecture Overview

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| ⚡ Native ESM Architecture | Fully structured using modern ECMAScript Modules (`type: module`) and designed for Node.js >=22 environments. |
| 🪶 Lean Dependency Strategy | Only feature-driven packages are included (image processing, scraping, scheduling) to avoid unnecessary overhead. |
| 🧩 Runtime Minimalism | No obfuscation, or bundling layers are used, ensuring predictable execution and optimal performance. |

### 📄 System Requirements

| 🔹 Minimum | ✨ Recommended |
|------------|------------|
| 1 vCPU | 1 vCPU |
| 1 GB RAM | 1 GB RAM |
| 1 GB Free Space | 2 GB Free Space |

### 🗄️ Server

To run the bot, I highly recommend the following services. They are not only affordable, but also ensure that user data stored in the database remains secure:

- [x] NAT VPS [Hostdata](https://hostdata.id/nat-vps-usa/) (Highly Recommended)
- [x] Hosting Panel [The Hoster](https://thehoster.net/bot-hosting/)
- [x] VPS [OVH Hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/vps/)

### 📥 Installation & Run

> [!IMPORTANT]
Check this repository regularly for updates. The project is still under development. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue. Thank you!

> [!NOTE]
I’m not familiar with Windows because I primarily use Linux, so no Windows installation files are provided.

Ensure that your configuration and server meet the requirements to avoid errors during installation or while running the bot. Then execute the following command on your Linux console:
```bash
$ bash install.sh

# And, run the bot

$ pm2 start app.config.cjs && pm2 logs bot
```

### 🔧 Configuration

   // Owner phone number
   ownerNumber: '6281111111111',

   // Bot name
   botName: 'Starseed',

   // Footer text
   footer: '✦ Starseed',

   defaultLimit: 15,

   // Sticker pack name

   },
   group: false, // is this command only for group chats?
